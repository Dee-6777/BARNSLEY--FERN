# BARNSLEY--FERN
Barnsley fern is a fractal shape created by mathematician Michael Barnsley. The geometric features of this fractal resemble a natural fern and hence it gets its name. Barnsley fern is created by iterating over a large number of times on four mathematical equations, introduced by Barnsley, known as Iterated Function System (IFS).
